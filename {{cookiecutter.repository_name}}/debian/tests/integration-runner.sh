# It is unclear when `systemctl` is and is not blocking. If the call to seed /home/patient is non-blocking
# then there is a theoretical race condition here where nodm will start running at a point in time when not
# all of the necessary config files are present in /home/patient.
#
# The consequence of this is that strange errors will occur that look like missing configuration files, and
# when the developer digs in to see if the config files are missing, they will be present. If this is the case
# then an intelligent wait loop with a reasonable timeout will need to be implemented to guarantee completion
# of gwn-seed-patient.service
