_template
=========

The `_template` repository provides a set of templates for use with cookiecutter
(https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


branches
========

Different types of templates (e.g. "a python library", "a dbus service") are
provided by the branches in this repository.

The `master` branch serves as a blank, mostly empty repository template that
provides only our standard debian packaging boilerplate. It's a good starting
point if you want to create a new template from (nearly) scratch.
